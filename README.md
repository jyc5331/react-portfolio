### Portfolio

This page is Joseph Cosgrove's portfolio. Joseph's other work can be found at: https://github.com/jyc5331

A link to the deployed portfolio: https://jyc5331.github.io/react-portfolio/

This portfolio was created with React and the following technologies: Grommet, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and Node.JS. It was a pleasure to recreate this portfolio with something more intricate than vanilla HTML and CSS, and I look forward to using it as a starting point for developing my skills with new languages and libraries.
